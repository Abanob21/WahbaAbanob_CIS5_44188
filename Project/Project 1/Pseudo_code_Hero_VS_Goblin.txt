//Declare and Initialize boolean variable isRunni to true for executing rounds
// This is a boolean variable
// This is a string variable
// Get user choice 1 for  Hero , 0 for Goblin

// Declare and Intialize Goblin skills and power parameters to zero
//Seed the random function generation with current time
// Give goblin random health, attack, defence value
//Give the hero random health, attack, defence value
//Beginning of the while loop
// Armor Zone : If hero and goblin attack parameter is less than zero set it to zero
// Life steal Zone : Assign Hero and Goblin life random  value
